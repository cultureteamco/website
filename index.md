    text:
      "Straight away from the onset, there were some laughs with Happy Salmon, a bit of that competitive spirit coming out - and then the messages of what it actually means to make it relatable to what we do day-to-day came straight through as well - without overdoing it.We really had the right balance of team building, a bit of fun, but something meaningful we can take back to our personal and work lives. I think it adds a lot of value to take that time out of the day. Everyone’s as busy as they’ve ever been, so being able to go into a room and have a bit of fun, do something that breaks up the day and brings teams together is hugely valuable."
