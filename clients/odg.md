    desc: Adapted from ‘Playdough & Mime’, teams explored the story of a particular character and the way they interacted with government services. From there, they examined the core needs of that user and then presented the unit’s value proposition with graphical and verbal components. This game is a great introduction to design thinking, for those unfamiliar with the principles and processes.

## Office for Digital Government

The Office for Digital Government invited us to be a part of their strategic planning day. They
weren’t exactly sure what they wanted at first, but once they’d learnt how our process works and
that we’re able to slip into a quick meeting at short notice, we collaborated on a very meaningful
set of outcomes.

ODG’s teams were required to pitch the value proposition of the business during the strategy
day. In preparation for this pitch, Culture Team would get them in the mindset to approach the
question; ‘What is the purpose of the unit?’, among others. Then, on the actual day, Culture
Team would run a second session, focused on team bonding.

We customised ‘Playdough & Mime’ (link to game) to take the teams on a journey through the
user’s eyes, enabling them to reach a conclusion on the value proposition, from the user’s
perspective. The exercise was so successful that the team, being agile, decided that continuing
with the planned pitches would be superfluous.

Rejoining the team a couple of days later to slip seamlessly into their strategy day felt like
rejoining friends.

#### Testimonial

When we were figuring out what to do for the session, you heard us and
listened to what we needed and you understood. You definitely responded and
tailored the offerings that you had to meet our needs. It was a bit last minute,
we didn’t know exactly what we wanted, but you were flexible. We threw out the
problems and you offered the solutions, using your experience.

The team were expecting the usual team building; one of the guys who was
really opposed, literally stomping his feet before the day, got really into it once
he was playing the game. It appealed to introverts and extroverts, alike and
engagement in our strategy day really changed after the games.

Part of the experience was that you just came in, you ran the session and you
left. It wasn’t this big onerous thing. It was all seamless. It was really, really
good.
