#### Testimonial

The opportunity for a short event within the office was really attractive to me. I was excited to be able to show my team that the office can be a place for fun - and it really was fun! I was on the floor laughing within the first ten minutes!

The message of valuing everybody’s input was clear to the whole team and everyone came away feeling energised. I can see a lot of opportunities for short sessions like these fitting in where we would normally have a team meeting. Thank you again for an awesome event!

* Kylie Bailey, Associate Director of Mobile Service

Straight away from the onset, there were some laughs with Happy Salmon, a bit of that competitive spirit coming out - and then the messages of what it actually means to make it relatable to what we do day-to-day came straight through as well - without overdoing it. We really had the right balance of team building, a bit of fun, but something meaningful we can take back to our personal and work lives. I think it adds a lot of value to take that time out of the day. Everyone’s as busy as they’ve ever been, so being able to go into a room and have a bit of fun, do something that breaks up the day and brings teams together is hugely valuable.

* Jarrod Fehlmann, Service Delivery Manager
