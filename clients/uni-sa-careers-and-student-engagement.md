## {{short-title}}

Uni SA’s Student Engagement team run a variety of leadership development programs for students. They offer a range of self-development workshops, both for students enrolled in a leadership program and for those looking for something short and specific to help them with their career. 

We delivered a session to help students improve their communication skills. Students learnt to communicate effectively, work in a team environment and develop skills to better understand the people they interact with.

#### Testimonial

Kelly and Jeff from Culture Team delivered energetic game-based workshops as part of our student self-development programs. The games were well planned and executed and the enthusiasm of the facilitators added to the overall experience for the students. These workshops would be ideal during orientation or for activation activities where you’re looking to energise students or emphasise wellbeing.
