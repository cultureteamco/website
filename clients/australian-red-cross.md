## {{short-title}}

The HR team at Red cross hadnâ€™t done any team building in a while, so were due for some fun and bonding when they brought us in to play. They all work separately, but have a shared purpose as they work towards a common goal. 

To assist in their sense of togetherness as they contributed across different projects, we designed a session focused on communication and collaborative problem solving. 

The teamâ€™s calm, empathetic disposition shone through during the intense bomb game and participants got a real surprise when they saw the results of the tower building game.

#### Testimonial

Culture team tailored a session to a group of us from different departments of Red Cross to have some time to bond and have fun.

Kelly and Jeff came in and set up the space, so all we had to do was walk in and play. The games allowed us to work together in different formats, under different circumstances, and have a laugh along the way. It was a great way to break up the day, and by the end of the session everyone was noticeably relaxed and refreshed.
