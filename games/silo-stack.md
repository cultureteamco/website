#### Takeaways

* Cross-Team Communication
  *  It’s easy to forget when everyone’s working in a different department, or on a different project that we’re all on the same team. We can all be working away, trying to solve the same problem individually and not get very far. We can all be working on separate pieces of the puzzle and not understand our place in it. Or, we can reach out to one another and ensure success for every person involved.
