#### Takeaways

Every session is different. This game can open up discussion for numerous different outcomes;
some takeaway message include:

* Rapid Prototyping
  * When we give planners plenty of time, they use it to discuss, plan and then build. Doers get far less time, so all they can do is build. Then they do it again. And again. Building and trying out different options creates a far better result than simply building the tower once. The doers win this game every time.
* Lean & Agile 
  * Build > Measure > Learn > Build > Measure > Learn > Build > Measure > Learn. This game is a great mindset shifter for any resistors to Lean or Agile methodologies.

#### Case studies

When we played Playdough Towers with the South Australian Red Cross, two teams attempted to build the tallest tower. One team had different time constraints than the other, unbeknownst to them. The team of planners tried more than once to build their tower, adopting an iterative process. Still, the team that prototyped more over shorter periods took the victory.
