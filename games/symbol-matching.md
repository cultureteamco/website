#### Takeaways

* Icebreaking
  * The more people you speak to, the better chance you have of winning. This game is a quick way to encourage interaction en masse. Emphasising the personal communication on the reverse side of the cards allows participants to find common ground and get to know each other better.

* Clarity of Communication
  * Explaining the symbols on the cards requires some creative articulation. You might explain in one way to a close friend, a different way to a stranger, and a different way again to someone from a different language background to you. This game gets players thinking about how their speech is received by others and how to tailor their message to suit the listener.
