## Yes, But...Yes, And...

{{>game-overview}}

#### Takeaways

Every session is different. This game can open up discussion for numerous different
outcomes; some takeaway message include:

* Teamwork
  * Every day of your adult lives you've played 'yes, but'. It's a polite way of saying no; of coming up with an excuse not to do something instead of just giving it a go. This game is about reframing your mindset and challenging yourself to see problems as opportunities.
* Resilience
  * The reason role-play makes us so uncomfortable is because we don’t know what’s about to happen. Putting ourselves in a consequence-free situation where we can practice dealing with that discomfort builds resilience and better equips us to deal with the unexpected when it shows up in the real world.

  * In this extension option, we introduce SOLER methodology; use your body language to encourage others to open up to you.

#### Case studies

We ran a communication workshop for Uni SA’s ‘Aspire’ program, in which students with a strong leadership record were encouraged to apply. Participants from many CALD backgrounds supported each other to step out of their comfort zones and explore the way we use language; with our words and our bodies.
