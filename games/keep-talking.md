title: Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes
synopsis: Bomb defusal is a lot easier when you have friends helping you out!
duration: 45-90 mins
quote: I felt confused and annoyed at first when my team mates couldn’t give me the answers for how to defuse the bomb. I didn’t understand what was going on at their side and I thought, ‘they only have to read from paper!’ However, when I changed to their side, I realised that it’s not so easy, so I understood their situation. I definitely felt closer to my teammates by the end of the activity, as we all had common goals that we worked towards.
other-quotes:
  - In the bomb game, individual strengths showed up and were accepted, which led to ownership and success.
  - In the defuse-a-bomb session, everyone knew their role, had responsibility, had experience to draw on - it was a real well-oiled machine.
  - I felt a real sense of teamwork during the defusing-the-bomb. I’d never worked with this group of people before and after 5 minutes of working together, we were communicating, really understanding each other and flew through the challenge.
  - I felt a real sense of teamwork in the bomb disposal game when I got the wires module wrong 3 times in a row, but my team still let me keep trying.

#### Takeaways

Every session is different. This game can open up discussion for numerous different outcomes; some takeaway message include:

* Shared Communication Modes
  * The key to any team communicating effectively and efficiently is developing a shared language early on and understanding what information is important.
* Cross-Departmental Understanding
  * The bomb defuser sees things completely differently to the bomb experts; 3D rather than 2D,colour rather than monochrome, intuition rather than words; having both sides come to realise their own biases and limitations opens them up to being more empathetic toward the rest of their team.

#### Case studies

To bring RSPCA’s entire inspection and rescue team together, we developed a leadership edition of Keep Talking. The team, which is made up of two distinct sub-teams, were able to develop an appreciation for the different strengths and limitations that each member was working with.

With the South Australian Office for Digital Government, two large, leadership edition teams shared information and developed distinct styles of working. Examining the methods and success of the two teams made for some very interesting discussion.
