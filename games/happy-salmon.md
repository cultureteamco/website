#### Takeaways

This game can have multiple outcomes, depending on the extension option chosen. The game, at its core, is a great way to start every session. The speed, energy, vocals and physical touch shared between participants breaks down barriers quickly, boosts endorphins, and builds trust.

#### Extension option
* Selfless mode
  * Two teams compete; the first with original Happy Salmon rules, the second with the ability to behave selflessly. The selfless team always finds a way to be more productive than the players that need something in return.
* Relay mode
  * We celebrate diversity by making players look outside of their teams for matching handshakes.

#### Case studies

The Uni SA Business Schoolâ€™s Executive Education Unit had us in for a quick icebreaker session to lift their energy before going in to a big strategy meeting. Happy Salmon was the perfect game to kick this off and the high-energy it created helped the group speed through two more games in a 30 minute session!
