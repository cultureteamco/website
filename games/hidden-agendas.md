#### Takeaways

When someone gives us a reaction we weren’t expecting, it’s easy to assume the worst. This
game is about examining the difference between the assumptions we make and the true
motivations of the people we’re interacting with. More often than not, the truth will leave us
feeling more positive and confident than the reasoning we imagine in our head.

#### Case studies

We ran a critical thinking workshop for the women in business group, Her Future Moves.
Participants who had been apprehensive, stepped out of their comfort zones and came away
feeling confident. Some remarked that they had surprised themselves with their initial
assumptions and this game helped them to examine their thinking in a new way.
