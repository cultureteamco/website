## Playdough & Mime

{{>game-overview}}

#### Takeaways

Every session is different. This game can open up discussion for numerous different outcomes;
some takeaway message include:

* Genuine Engagement
  * At the end of the exercise, every person is able to explain their idea - they’re even willing to join their team in presenting it as a mime! The way we get this level of engagement right through to the end of a project is to ensure everyone has an equal contribution at the very beginning. Players experience service-leadership through this game.
* Design Thinking
  * Players go through a process of rapid ideation (divergent thinking), discussion and refinement (convergent thinking) and presentation (testing). It’s a fast paced game to demonstrate the ease in which teams can explore and test ideas in an iterative process.

#### Case studies

South Australia’s Office for Digital Government wanted all of their staff to contribute to their strategic planning day by developing a pitch. To prepare them for the pitch, we played a customised version of Playdough & Mime with them. Teams used playdough to explore a user journey, they mapped out the core needs of the user, and then presented the value-proposition of the ODG from the perspective of that user. The game was so successful, leaders decided, that teams no longer needed to prepare a separate pitch.
