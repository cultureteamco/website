#### Takeaways

Every session is different. This game can open up discussion for numerous different outcomes; some takeaway messages include:
* Anyone can be a leader
  * Its in your approach to the task and your willingness to help your teammates that defines you as a leader.
* We excel as a team when we’re committed to a common purpose. 
  * If you can’t commit to where the team’s headed, you have two options; help to steer the ship or get out of the boat; by staying silent, you’re just pulling in the wrong direction.
