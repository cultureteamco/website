## Our Purpose

We are on a mission to infect individuals with a team mindset.

## Our Values

1. People first.
  * We value relationships above all else.
  * We make decisions and develop our service based on observation and human needs.
  * We think of the team before ourselves.

2. Radiate Energy.
  * We explore the ‘yes’ before jumping to the ‘no’.
  * We are intentional in the energy we radiate and make our presence meaningful.
  * We give our full attention and show our interest.

3. Openness.
  * We avoid falseness.
  * We prioritise collaboration above keeping secrets.
  * We own our mistakes and learn from our failures.

## What does it mean to have a ‘Team Mindset’?

1. Considering others.

You consider the needs and desires of people other than yourself.

2. Impacting others.

You acknowledge that you have influence over others - whether you intend to or not - and you choose to be intentional with that influence.

3. Sharing openly.

You see individual vulnerability not as a threat, but as something that makes the team stronger.

4. Embracing the global human team.

You expand the concept of who’s on your team to embrace outsiders. Learn more about our team and {{>link link-page="our-story" text="our story"}}.
