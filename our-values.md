#### What does it mean to have a ‘Team Mindset’?

* Considering others.
  * You consider the needs and desires of people other than yourself.
* Impacting others.
  * You acknowledge that you have influence over others - whether you intend to or not - and you choose to be intentional with that influence.
* Sharing openly.
  * You see individual vulnerability not as a threat, but as something that makes the team stronger.
* Embracing the global human team.
  * You expand the concept of who’s on your team to embrace outsiders.
